    '''**Generates a test event at the chosen interval.**

    This module is only available for testing purposes and has further hardly any use.

    Events have following format:

        { "header":{}, "data":"test" }

    Parameters:

        - name (str):               The instance name when initiated.

        - interval (float):         The interval in seconds between each generated event.
                                    Should have a value > 0.
                                    default: 1

    Queues:

        - outbox:    Contains the generated events.
